=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::BasicAuthPlus> is a helper for basic HTTP
authentication that supports multiple authentication schemes, including
a callback, explicit username and password (plaintext or encrypted) without
a callback, a passwd file, LDAP, and Active Directory.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::BasicAuthPlus> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 C<register>

    $plugin->register;

Register condition in L<Mojolicious> application.

=head2 C<basic_auth>

Configure specific auth method (see CONFIGURATION).  Returns 1 on success,
0 on failure.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The basic_auth method takes an HTTP Basic Auth realm name that is either a
code ref for a subroutine that will do the authentication check, or a hash,
where the realm is the hash name.  When the realm represents a named hash,
the key/value pairs specify the source of user credentials and determine the
method used for authentication (e.g., passwd file, LDAP, Active Directory).

Realm names may contain whitespace.

If a username and password are defined, then other options pertaining to a
passwd file or LDAP/ActiveDirectory authentication will be ignored, because it
it assumed you intend to compare the defined username and password against
those supplied by the user.

The following options may be set in the hash:

=head2 username

Specify the username to match.

=head2 password

Specify the password to match.  The string may be plaintext or use any of the
formats noted in L<Authen::Simple::Password>.

=head2 path

The location of a password file holding user credentials.  Per
L<Authen::Simple::Passwd>, "Any standard passwd file that has records seperated
with newline and fields seperated by ":" is supported.  First field is expected
to be username and second field, plain or encrypted password.  Required."

=head2 host

The hostname or IP address of an LDAP or Active Directory server.

=head2 basedn

The base DN to use with LDAP or Active Directory.

=head2 binddn

The bind DN to use when doing an authenticated bind against LDAP or Active
Directory.

=head2 bindpw

The password to use when doing an authenticated bind to LDAP or Active
Directory.

=head2 filter

The LDAP/ActiveDirectory filter to use when searching a directory.
